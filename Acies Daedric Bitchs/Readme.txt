Daedric Bitchs ported to FNV by Acies
Original Mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100519
Sharpened teeth texture: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71806


To switch between sharpened teeth and human teeth, go to textures\Acies\PeiRace
	pick the folder: mouth demon or mouth human
	replace the mouthhuman.dds in textures\Acies\PeiRace
	
The races have no hairs, you need a hair patcher to automatically add hairs to all the races.
I won't be working any longer on this port, it's not perfect and there might be bugs or issues I am too lazy to fix.
