Requirements now are Tales of Two Wastelands
Mikados beauty pack
and instead of making a companion scrpit because they get buggy im using jip companion control center.


The creator of this race mod gave his goahead to recreate his wonderful mod so here it goes....
First I added 3 companions 
You could recruit one in jipccc and through dialog have others follow that one or have them all recruited.
You can interact with them in the dialog but it may cause issues if using jipcc on the companion your trying to talk to.
